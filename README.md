# Easy Travel

## Context:
I completed Easy Travel as part of my final project of module 2 out of 4 coursework for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of four days. The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning travel booking app that shows a user's past trips and requested pending trips.
