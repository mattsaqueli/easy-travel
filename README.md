# Easy Travel

## Context:
I completed Easy Travel as part of my final project of module 2 out of 4 coursework for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of four days. The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning travel booking app that shows a user's past trips and requested pending trips.

## Installation Instructions:
Fork this repo.
Clone down the forked repo by running git clone [remote-address].
Move into the directory.
Run npm install.

## Learning Goals:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Wins/Challenges:
Win: Writing clean Javascript that other developers can understand. Using iterators methods efficiently after only 5 weeks of exposure to them.
Challenges: One challenege I faced in this project was accessing and manipulating api data. Another challenege was writing tests that test both happy and sad paths while completing the project in time. 

## Future Addition:
- Add more happy and sad path tests
- Add a Admin view where you can see all requested pending trips. Admin can then approve or deny the pending trips
